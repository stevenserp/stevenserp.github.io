  <p> The name that most people know me by is Steven X. Serpico this website is just a few of many pieces of work done over the course of my high school and college career. The pieces that I have chosen showcase my strongest medium and one image is something that I just started dabbling recently. Most of my work on this website consist of charcoal drawing as well as the medium commonly known as pen and ink. There is one photograph I shot when I was just learning photogranphy at the time and I think that it represents my style and asthetic.</p>

  <p> The images are done in pen and ink or charcoal. These mediums are more tactile and require a lot of patience. With charcoal the drawer must understand the elements of space and using shapes to create an image, and with pen I use many different methods to create shadow, texture, and form. I hope visitors like my work and can appreciate what I have created just as much as I do.</p>
